                    <p>By subscribing to or purchasing any services offered by JAAT-AI, you agree to this Refund Policy. Please read this policy carefully before making any payments.</p>

                    <h2>1. Subscription Refunds</h2>
                    <p>JAAT-AI offers subscription-based services with the following refund terms:</p>
                    
                    <h3>1.1 Cooling-off Period</h3>
                    <p>For first-time subscribers, we offer a 7-day money-back guarantee from the date of initial subscription purchase. If you are not satisfied with our service within the first 7 days, you may request a full refund by contacting our support team at support@jaat-ai.com.</p>
                    <p>To be eligible for a refund during the cooling-off period, you must:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Make the request within 7 days of the initial subscription purchase</li>
                        <li>Provide a reason for your dissatisfaction with the service</li>
                        <li>Have not violated our Terms of Service</li>

                    <h3>1.2 Post Cooling-off Period</h3>
                    <p>After the 7-day cooling-off period, subscriptions are generally non-refundable for the current billing cycle. However, you may cancel your subscription at any time to prevent future billing cycles.</p>
                    <p>When you cancel your subscription:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You will continue to have access to the service until the end of your current billing cycle</li>
                        <li>No further charges will be made for subsequent billing periods</li>
                        <li>No partial refunds will be issued for the unused portion of the current billing period</li>

                    <h2>2. Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
                    <p>We understand that exceptional circumstances may arise. We may consider refund requests outside the cooling-off period in the following situations:</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.1 Service Unavailability</h3>
                    <p>If our service experiences significant downtime (more than 24 consecutive hours) or persistent technical issues that prevent you from using the service as advertised, you may be eligible for a partial or full refund for the affected period. Such circumstances will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.2 Billing Errors</h3>
                    <p>If you have been charged incorrectly or multiple times for your subscription, please contact our support team immediately with documentation of the error. We will investigate the issue and process a refund for any incorrect charges.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2.3 Unauthorized Charges</h3>
                    <p>If you discover unauthorized charges for JAAT-AI services on your account, please contact us immediately. We take security very seriously and will investigate such claims thoroughly.</p>
